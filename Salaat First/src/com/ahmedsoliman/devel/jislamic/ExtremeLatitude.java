/**
 * 
 * At certain locations and times of year, some prayer times do not occur or
 * otherwise are impossible to precisely calculate using conventional means.
 * These methods generally apply to locations with High latitudes (near or above
 * 49 degrees) or locations of Extreme proportion (near or above 66 degrees).
 * 
 * Method Category Information:
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>Nearest Latitude (Aqrab Al-Bilaad): Calculate a prayer time using a safe
 * latitude value. The recommended latitude by many schools of Fiqh is 48.5
 * degrees, but you can customize this by setting the "Method.setNearestLat()"
 * method.</li>
 * <li>Nearest Good Day (Aqrab Al-Ayyam): The library determines the closest
 * previous or next day that the Fajr and Ishaa times occur and are both valid.</li>
 * <li>An [amount] of Night and Day: Unlike the above mentioned methods, the
 * multiple methods in this category have no proof in traditional Shari'a (Fiqh)
 * resources. These methods were introduced by modern day Muslim scholars and
 * scientists for practical reasons only.</li>
 * <li>Minutes from Shurooq/Maghrib: Use an interval time to calculate Fajr and
 * Ishaa. This will set the values of Fajr and Ishaa to the same as the computed
 * Shurooq and Maghrib respectively, then add or subtract the amount of minutes
 * found in the "Method.getFajrInv" and "Method.getIshaaInv" methods.</li>
 * </ul>
